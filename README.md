# Refactoring

## Description

Please refactor the CustomerService.cs (its Add method). You can assume, that the business logic of the service is working as expected and does not need any improvements. Only focus on applying clean code principles like SOLID, KISS and DRY.

Try to solve this task in approximately 2-3 hours. Should you still have ideas for improvement after 3h hours have passed, stop refactoring, write them down and explain them in your interview.

## Limitations

The Program.cs file in MyApp.Console must NOT CHANGE AT ALL. This includes using statements in that file. Please assume, that the code is part of a larger project and any non backward compatible change will break that project.

You are allowed to change all files, with the exception of CustomerDataAccess and its AddCustomer method, in the MyApp-Project. The CustomerDataAccess class and the AddCustomer method must stay static.
